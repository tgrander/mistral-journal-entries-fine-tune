    "\n",
    "- `tokenizer.add_eos_token = True` and `tokenizer.add_bos_token = True` are set to automatically append end-of-sequence (EOS) and beginning-of-sequence (BOS) tokens. This is crucial if the model's training expects every input sequence to start with a BOS token and end with an EOS token.\n",

    "### 🤔 Why did we choose this formatter func?\n",
    "I found the choice to use this formatter function interesting. It opened my eyes to the significance of properly formatting prompts for effective model training. This formatter in particular allows us to train the model only on inputs (the journal entries) without the need for output targets. If we were going for Q&A dialogue format, we would have gone with something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def formatting_func(example):\n",
    "    text = f\"### Question: {example['input']}\\n ### Answer: {example['output']}\"\n",
    "    return text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🍀 Benefits of Formatter Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**🕊️ Simplifies Data Preparation**  \n",
    "- No need for explicit output targets simplifies dataset preparation.\n",
    "- Focus is solely on formatting inputs (journal entries) correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🤸‍♀️ Flexibility in Model Use**  \n",
    "- Training with input-only (journal entries) enhances model's understanding of style, tone, and content.\n",
    "- Post-training, the model can:\n",
    "  - Generate content similar to the training data.\n",
    "  - Answer questions related to the content.\n",
    "  - Continue a journal entry in a consistent style.\n",
    "\n",
    "**💪🏽 Leverages Internal Model Capabilities**  \n",
    "- Utilizes the pre-training of advanced language models on extensive text data.\n",
    "- Fine-tunes model's inherent language and structure understanding.\n",
    "- Aligns model capabilities with the specific style and content of journal entries without needing output targets."

    "### 🔮 Invoke Eevee the Dog with Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be prompted for inference in any of the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variations of the Header**\n",
    "You can use variations of the original header that maintain the essence but change the phrasing. For example:  \n",
    "    - \"Eevee the Dog wrote the following note:\"\n",
    "    - \"Note by Eevee the Dog:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Contextual or Thematic Prompts**\n",
    "If the journal entries are themed or contextualized, you can prompt the model using these themes or contexts. For instance:\n",
    "    - \"Reflecting on a day in the park, Eevee the Dog noted:\"\n",
    "    - \"In a mood of contemplation, Eevee the Dog wrote:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Direct Questions or Statements**\n",
    "You can also use direct questions or statements related to the content of the journals. For example:\n",
    "    - \"What did Eevee the Dog say about his adventures today?\"\n",
    "    - \"Describe a recent experience of Eevee the Dog.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using Keywords or Topics**\n",
    "Prompt the model with specific keywords or topics that are prevalent in the journal entries. For example:\n",
    "    - \"Discuss Eevee the Dog's thoughts on happiness.\"\n",
    "    - \"Eevee the Dog's perspective on friendship:\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Narrative or Storytelling Starters**\n",
    "Engage the model with a narrative starter that aligns with the style of the journal entries. For example:\n",
